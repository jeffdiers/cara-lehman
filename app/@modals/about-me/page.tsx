              I am an experienced software engineer and application developer
              passionate about driving digital transformation and creating
              innovative solutions. With expertise in full-stack development, I
              leverage a diverse skill set in popular languages, frameworks, and
              libraries including TypeScript, MongoDB, SQL, GO, React.js,
              Next.js, jQuery, and Node.js.

              Currently, I am a Senior Software Engineer at Jona, where I
              contribute to a high-paced startup environment, developing and
              maintaining a customer-facing web application powered by AI. My
              work focuses on enhancing user experience and system performance
              through the development of both frontend UI components and backend
              APIs.

              My career spans across several companies where I have consistently
              delivered high-quality code and collaborated with cross-functional
              teams to create scalable, sustainable, and accessible solutions. I
              have a strong background in developing AI-powered tools,
              optimizing web performance, and building comprehensive UI
              component libraries.

              Beyond my professional work, I enjoy exploring the complexities of
              software engineering and staying updated with the latest industry
              trends. When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me spending quality
              time with my dog, Bernie üê∂.
